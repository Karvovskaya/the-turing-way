# Repositories and Archives

<!----
Some inital discussion between Lena, Eirini and Malvika

Clarify the meaning of the term Repository - also for the previous chapter

(ispiration from the FAIR coockbook - the Zenodo posting)

Types of repositories

Originally: How to get started with OSF

OSF itself

Guide for project design
after creating a project repository chapter add a new chapter

Creating a chapter on different archives (also opens a door to write about Zotero)

cross-reference with Zenodo and Figshare repositories (making research project citable in Communication)

OSF can help you through your whole projects

Sub-projects are similar to subfolders
Different privacy settings for submodules

Private links for reviewers

Combination of GitHub and Zenodo

(another way to put it is collaboration)

## Summary

Intro: all repositories you can use along the way of your research 
<!-- Tools to store and share research outcomes from various stages of the cycle? 
Find & compare disciplinary repositories through Repository of Research Data Repositories https://www.re3data.org/

## Motivation

Why sharing data is a good idea is covered in other places in these guides, e.g. [Motivations for sharing and archiving data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-sharing.html?highlight=repository#motivations-for-sharing-data) and [Open data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-data.html#open-data).

After making the decision to share data, or other research outputs, another decision needs to be made: *where* to share those research outputs. This chapter outlines some od the crucial functionalities that you should look out for when picking where to share your data, code, slides, or any other research output.
